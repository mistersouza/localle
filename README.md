### Wireframes

‚ñ∑ We're all about that sleek vibe with a single font family to keep things clean and seamless. But hey, the future looks spicy! We're diving into custom font territory, backed by loads of UX research, sharper business goals, and some epic partnerships.

Started with a free template to hustle up our MVP launch - gotta nail those must-haves, you know? But hey, that's just phase one! Digging deep into UX research and leveling up with TechLabs training means big things for this project's next chapter.
