### Wireframes

‚ñ∑ We're all about that sleek vibe with a single font family to keep things clean and seamless. But hey, the future looks spicy! We're diving into custom font territory, backed by loads of UX research, sharper business goals, and some epic partnerships.

Started with a free template to hustle up our MVP launch - gotta nail those must-haves, you know? But hey, that's just phase one! Digging deep into UX research and leveling up with TechLabs training means big things for this project's next chapter.

### Color Scheme

‚ñ∑ In the initial design phase, we're rocking a grayscale palette to highlight content structure and nail that user experience. Once we've aced the UX research, we're bringing in accent colors to jazz up the design and make user interaction smoother.

## Deployment

### GitPod

‚ñ∑ Getting your app ready

- Open up your settings.py file 
    - Setup databse
        ```python
        import dj_database_url

        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL>")
        }
        ```
    - Update settings.py in your Django app
        ```python
        DEBUG = False
        ```
    - Update Allowed Hosts
        ```python
        ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
        ```

- On the CL
    - Create a requirements. This file tells Heroku what your app needs to run smoothly.
        ```bash
        pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
        ```
    - Craft a Procfile. This tells Heroku how to run your app. Think of it as the main instruction manual.
        ```bash
        echo web: python app.py > Procfile
        ```
    - Shift models to ElephantSQL.
        ```bash
        python3 manage.py makemigrations
        python3 manage.py migrate
        ```

‚ñ∑ The site first brewed up in GitPod and then landed in this remote [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mistersouza/localle.git).And let's talk GIT ‚Äì the commands that made the magic real.

- **git status** >> It's like peeking into the project's mood board - shows any changes or new stuff.
- **git add --all** >> The "get ready to party" move - stages files for the big commit.
- **git commit -m " "** >> The official seal of approval - commits all the files.
- **git push** >> The grand finale - sends everything to the master branch up there on GitHub. Boom!

### Heroku 

‚ñ∑ After all that hustle, it's time to set this project free in the wild, wild web world. Let it spread its wings and conquer the digital realm! 

- Started fresh on Heroku and gave our app a European vibe.
- Swiped right for GitHub as our deployment wingman.
- Dropped in some super-secret config vars for that behind-the-scenes magic. Check out the cool settings
